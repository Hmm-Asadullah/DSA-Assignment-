# DSA Assignment

Welcome to the **DSA Assignment** repository. This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, divided into four key programs. Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific application of DSA principles.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **BinarySearch.cpp**

This file implements the Binary Search algorithm for arrays and singly linked lists. Key functionalities include:

- **Binary Search on Arrays**: Efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array.
- **Binary Search on Linked Lists**: Implements binary search on sorted singly linked lists.
- **Performance Analysis**: Measures execution time for binary search on arrays and linked lists for varying input sizes.

#### How to Run:
The main function demonstrates binary search on both arrays and linked lists with varying input sizes. Execution time is measured and displayed for analysis.

### 2. **CustomerList.cpp**

This file manages customer data using a singly linked list. Key functionalities include:

- **VIP Management**: Moves customers with more than 10 orders to a VIP list.
- **Low-Order Removal**: Removes customers with fewer than 3 orders.
- **Order Summation**: Calculates the total number of orders in the list.
- **Print Operations**: Displays customer IDs and their order counts.

#### How to Run:
The main function initializes a list with randomly generated order counts, demonstrates the functionalities, and displays results at each step.

### 3. **ExpressionEvaluation.cpp**

This file provides tools for handling arithmetic and logical expressions. Key functionalities include:

- **Expression Conversion**:
  - Infix to Postfix
  - Infix to Prefix
  - Prefix to Postfix
  - Postfix to Prefix
- **Expression Evaluation**: Evaluates arithmetic and logical expressions.
- **Validation**: Validates expressions for specific notations (prefix or postfix).
- **Expression Type Determination**: Determines if an expression is arithmetic, logical, or mixed.

#### How to Run:
The main function prompts the user for an infix expression and showcases various operations, including conversions, validation, and evaluation.

### 4. **WareHouseSystem.cpp**

This file simulates a multi-tier processing system for managing warehouse shipments. Key functionalities include:

- **Stack Operations**: Manages shipment IDs in a stack.
- **Queue Operations**: Handles dispatch requests.
- **Priority Queue**: Prioritizes dispatch requests based on priority levels.
- **System Display**: Visualizes the state of shipments and requests.

#### How to Run:
The main function demonstrates shipment unloading, dispatch requests, and system state display. Priority-based dispatch processing is showcased step-by-step.
